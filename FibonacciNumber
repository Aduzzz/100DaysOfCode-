                System.out.print(n1+" "+n2);//printing 0 and 1

                for(i=2;i<count;++i)//loop starts from 2 because 0 and 1 are already printed
                {
                    n3=n1+n2;
                    System.out.print(" "+n3);
                    n1=n2;
                    n2=n3;
                }

            }
    }

Explanation:
First initializing n1=0,n2=1,n3 and count as 10
Then printing 0 and 1 by using n1 and n2, after printing 
A forloop is introduced initializing i as 2 
because 0 and 1 is already printed.Then fibonacci
logic is applied inside the for loop and print the 
elements till count is 10 by using n3. 
Finally we'll get the output given below. 

Output:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
